This page assumes that you have gone through the [Getting Started guide](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/getting-started/signup) for creating an account.&#x20;

# Provisioning the device

Each device needs to be provisioned with a unique JSON file `device.json` that is used for authentication. Refer to the [Device Provisioning Guide](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/platform-guide/device-management/provisioning-a-device) to download the device configuration file.&#x20;

Rename the downloaded file to device.json and place it in the uplink data directory (/data/local/tmp/uplink in the example setup).

# Running Uplink

The entry point of the example setup is `service.sh`. You should ensure that it's started at boot with the correct privileges. In an AOSP setup, it would be done by adding a system service (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/init/README.md).
