[uplink](https://github.com/bytebeamio/uplink) is our device side sdk. It is an executable that is supposed to run on the device as a system service. It will handle communication with our backend, buffering of uploaded data to disk in case of bad network, OTAs and features like remote shell.

You can check out an example setup for android [here](https://github.com/bytebeamio/uplink/tree/main/examples/android). The entry point for this example setup is `service.sh`. There are a couple of configuration options in `env.sh`.
