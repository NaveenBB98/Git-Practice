Process stats allow you to monitor individual processes. To enable process stats we need to modify uplink's `config.toml` file to mention the process names that need monitoring. If you have followed the setup guide, this file should be present in `/usr/share/local/byebeam`. Add the below section to `config.toml`

```none
[system_stats]
enabled = true
process_names = ["uplink", "journalctl"]
update_period = 30

```

NOTE: The names of processes mentioned in the config should be the same as those in the output of `ps -eaf`

The stream corresponding to process stats is **uplink\_process\_stats**. This stream has the below fields

| Field name                | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pid                       | This field corresponds to a particular process's ID.                                        |
| start\_time               | Time at which the process had started execution.                                            |
| cpu\_usage                | Percentage of CPU being used by the process.                                                |
| mem\_usage                | RAM is used by the process, in bytes.                                                       |
| disk\_read\_bytes         | The number of bytes of data read from the disk(or storage device) since the last update.    |
| disk\_total\_read\_bytes  | Total number of bytes of data written to the disk(or storage device) since the last update. |
| disk\_write\_bytes        | A number of bytes of data read from the disk(or storage device) since the last update.      |
| disk\_total\_write\_bytes | Total number of bytes of data written to the disk(or storage device).                       |
