Using Bytebeam cloud, it is possible to view the logs of the device. Uplink is capable of collecting logcat logs and pushing them to cloud, which can then be visualized using the logs panel. You should create a stream called `logs` with this schema in your project:

Now, we need to create a "**logs**" dashboard.

# Create logs dashboard

Go to the "**Dashboards**" section of Bytebeam Cloud and select  "**Create Dashboard**"

Give the title "**logs**" and select the Dashboard type as "**Device Dashboard**". Click on submit.

The created dashboard should be visible now.

Click on the "**logs**" dashboard and select the device for which you want to see the logs.

Create a New Panel. Select the "Logs" panel.

Give the appropriate title and select the "**Logs**" option from the "**Table**" drop-down menu. Click on submit.

To enable the logging feature on the device, the following lines are to be added to the config.toml file.

```none
[logging]
# logcat tags you want to upload
tags = [
    "AndroidContext",
    "io.bytebeam.android_web_wrapper.BluetoothService.R1",
    "io.bytebeam.android_web_wrapper.interfaces.WifiInterface",
    "BluetoothGatt"
]
# 0 will collect all logs (VERBOSE) 
# 6 will collect only logs with priority "Fatal"
min_level = 6
stream_size = 32
```

Restart uplink.

The logs should be visible on the cloud now.
