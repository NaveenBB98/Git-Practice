You can use ByteBeam Client to push data to [Streams](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/platform-guide/streams-tables/introduction-to-streams).  Follow [Creating a Stream](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/platform-guide/streams-tables/creating-a-stream)  guide to create streams.

```rust
pub fn publish_to_stream(
        &self, // Bytebeam Client
        stream_name: &str,
        sequence: u32,
        payload: impl Serialize,
    ) -> anyhow::Result<u32>
```

Payload you want to publish must be something that can be Serialized to JSON.&#x20;

Lets say you have "**led\_status**" stream with field "**status**". You can create a struct and use **serde::Serialize** attribute.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct LedStream {
    // your custom fields!
    status: String,
}

fn main() {
    // ....
    let bytebeam_client = ByteBeamClient::init()?;

    let sequence = 1;
    let message = LedStream {
        status: "ON".into(),
    };

    // You can remove .expect and handle the error
    bytebeam_client
        .publish_to_stream("led_status", sequence, message)
        .expect("published successfully");
    //...
}

```

*NOTE: Every stream has ****id**** and ****timestamp**** fields as well, we add them internally, so it is recommended to not include them in your custom struct!*
