<Card title="TL;DR" >

Subscribe to `/tenants/{tenant_id}/devices/{device_id}/actions` to receive actions and publish the reponse to
`/tenants/{tenant_id}/devices/{device_id}/action/status` in JSON array format.

# Introduction

To trigger an action from the cloud follow the guides on [Creating new Action Types](/platform-guide/actions/action-settings/creating-an-action-type) and [Triggering an Action](/platform-guide/device-management/triggering-ota-update). Let us assume an action called `print` has been created that prints the payload:

### Receiving Action

[Actions](/platform-guide/actions/action-details/introduction) or commands can be received from Bytebeam by **subscribing** to the actions MQTT topic:

```
/tenants/{tenant_id}/devices/{device_id}/actions
```

Replace `{tenant_id}` with your project name and `{device_id}` with the device id.

<Note> *A device should only subscribe to the topic with tenant it is connected*. <br /> **_Device will be disconnected**  if device connected to tenant `demo`, tries to subscribe to topic with other tenant, say `mytenant`,
e.g. `/tenants/mytenant/devices/1/actions`</Note>

Once the action is triggered you will receive a message on MQTT:

```json
{
  "id": "3620695",
  "name": "print",
  "payload": "Hello World!",
}
```
here:
- `id`: An unique identifier generated for this event which will be used to ack back.
- `name`: Name of the action that is triggered
- `payload`: Optional payload that is provided while triggering the action

### Responding to Action with Action Status

We need to send a response back to the cloud to indicate progress of executing the command. This response must be published to:

```
/tenants/{tenant_id}/devices/{device_id}/action/status
```

And the payload should look like this:


```json
[
  {
    "id": "3620695",
    "timestamp": 1710774583249,
    "state": "Completed",
    "errors": [],
    "progress": 100
  }
]
```

In the above action response:

- `id`: Must be a string and the same `id` which was received with action
- `timestamp`: Timestamp in milliseconds
- `state`: can be any text to indicuate current status.
e.g. A long running commands, like OTA, might have multiple states "Downloading", "Updating ECU 1", "Updating ECU 2" so on so forth as statuses.
<Note>
`"Failed"` and `"Completed"` are special terminal states that indicate that the action is complete
</Note>
- `errors`: is an array of strings and is looked at _only if the `state` is sent as `"Failed"`_. The UI displays these errors. e.g. `["File not found"]`
- `progress`: Percentage in range 0 to 100 indicating progress within a given state. e.g. if `state` is "Downloading" and `progress` is 50 it means 50% of Downlaod is complete.
<Note>
`progress` is **_ignored_** if `state` is `"Completed"` or `"Failed"`
</Note>

<Tip>
For long running actions, periodically send the action status.

Sending action status as `"Received"` to notify the server that the action is received is optional but a good practice.
Send `"Completed"` or `"Failed"` status at the end of the action.
</Tip>

# Receiving actions using MQTTX

Open MQTTX and click on the `+ New Subscription` button:



![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/KgoQSkw-NkQJykt01OVJo/ouvtBHkW3DfPgk560M2ip_image.png)

Enter the topic (Replace tenant and device\_id) and set QoS to 1:


![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/KgoQSkw-NkQJykt01OVJo/MzOP8-VouiWP6MY1kG9fO_image.png)

Hit confirm. You should see the subscription now:

![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/KgoQSkw-NkQJykt01OVJo/57F304TNFHyYHM271I2Tw_image.png)

From the device management screen on your project trigger the print command:

![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/KgoQSkw-NkQJykt01OVJo/tWTrnsJqiqpnmBYVnJcOL_image.png)

This will open up a dialog as shown below. Enter payload and click on "Yes":



![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/KgoQSkw-NkQJykt01OVJo/BPuooOcYD_9ou4OyLf_R1_image.png)

You will see the action get created with status as "Initiated"

![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/KgoQSkw-NkQJykt01OVJo/waWofel1eKSFmxKYIOENp_image.png)

On  MQTTX you should now receive a message like below:

![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/KgoQSkw-NkQJykt01OVJo/trU6Hkle9xBdjMJKqKLa__image.png)



Notice the id in the payload matches the id on the you see on the UI. Ignore the additional field `kind`. That field has been deprecated.



You can send progress back as shown below:

![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/KgoQSkw-NkQJykt01OVJo/RN7s2Pxykh1A5zAKfev4v_image.png)

Do not forget to set the id to what was received in the message by you and also change `demo` and device id `2` to your tenant and device id

You should now be able to see the action as completed on the UI
