This page assumes that you have gone through the [Getting Started guide](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/getting-started/signup) for creating an account.&#x20;

# Provisioning the device

Each device needs to be provisioned with a unique JSON file `device.json` that is used for authentication. Refer to the [Device Provisioning Guide](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/platform-guide/device-management/provisioning-a-device) to download the device configuration file.&#x20;

Rename the downloaded file to device.json and place it in the "download" partition(/mnt/download) of the device. If you are connecting to the device via ssh you can use the below `scp` command. First, provide permission to the /mnt/download partition using `chmod` command.

```shell
chmod 777 /mnt/download
```

and then use `scp` command&#x20;

```shell
scp /home/bytebeam/Downloads/device.json user@<IP address of device>:/mnt/download
```

# Running Uplink

Start uplink and enable it to run at boot.

```shell
sudo systemctl start uplink
sudo systemctl enable uplink

```

To verify that the uplink is up and running, check the status in systemd, using the following command.

```shell
sudo systemctl status uplink
```

You should see the status as "active" like in the screenshot below:
