This guide will show you how to remotely monitor your device using Bytebeam Cloud. Uplink, by default, collects several parameters of the device, such as disk usage, system stats, and network usage. Each of these parameters is stored in different streams. Please refer to the pages below to see the parameters being collected in each stream.

- [System Stats](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/device-side-integrations/linux/monitoring-your-device/system-stats)
- [Network Stats](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/device-side-integrations/linux/monitoring-your-device/network-stats)
- [Process Stats](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/device-side-integrations/linux/monitoring-your-device/process-stats)
- [Disk Stats](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/device-side-integrations/linux/monitoring-your-device/disk-stats)
- [Processor Stats](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/device-side-integrations/linux/monitoring-your-device/processor-stats)&#x20;

You can create dashboards containing the required parameters. Follow the guides on [Creating a Dashboard](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/platform-guide/dashboards/creating-a-dashboard) and [Adding a Panel to Dashboard](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/platform-guide/dashboards/panels/introduction-to-panels) to learn how to work with dashboards.

Here is an example dashboard created for a few Linux devices, using the stats.
