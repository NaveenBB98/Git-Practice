System stats contain information regarding the kernel version, memory usage, uptime, load average, etc. These details are pushed to the `uplink_system_stats` stream.  This stream has the following fields:

| Field name         | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| kernel\_version    | The version of the currently running kernel.            |
| no\_processes      | Count of the currently running processes in the system. |
| uptime             | Time elapsed in seconds since the device has booted.    |
| total\_memory      | Total memory (RAM) present on the device in bytes       |
| used\_memory       | Amount of memory being used by the device in bytes      |
| available\_memory  | Memory available (unused) on the device in bytes        |
| load\_avg\_one     | One-minute load average of the system                   |
| load\_avg\_five    | Five-minute load average of the system                  |
| load\_avg\_fifteen | Fifteen-minute load average of the system               |
