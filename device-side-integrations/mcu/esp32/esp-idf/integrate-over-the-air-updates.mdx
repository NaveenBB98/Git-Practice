OTA update has become a critical requirement for devices being deployed remotely. This guide covers everything you need to know about Over the Air Firmware Upgrades with **bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk**.

## Enabling OTA Updates

OTA updates can be integrated into application by adding action handler for OTA updates.

```cpp
/* Below function call adds action handler for "update_firmware" action */
/* handle_ota is the pointer to action handler*/

bytebeam_add_action_handler(&bytebeam_client, handle_ota, "update_firmware");

/* Use the bytebeam_remove_action_handler api to remove the handler for the update
 * firmware action at any point of time in the code , Also you can  mantain the add
 * update firmware action handler and remove update firmware action handler flow as per
 * you application needs.
 */
// bytebeam_remove_action_handler(&bytebeam_client, "update_firmware");
```

Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/bytebeamio/esp-bytebeam-sdk/tree/main/examples/basic_ota" target="_blank">basic\_ota</a> example app for reference.

Follow the below steps to trigger OTA updates-

1. Upload a .bin file and create a new firmware version on Bytebeam as per the instructions mentioned in the [Creating a new Firmware Version](/platform-guide/actions/inventory-management/firmware-files/without-device-components/creating-a-new-firmware-version) guide. &#x20;
2. &#x20;Once, new firmware version is created, trigger OTA update as per the instructions mentioned in the [Triggering OTA update](/platform-guide/device-management/triggering-ota-update) guide.&#x20;
3. Progress of the firmware update can be monitored on Bytebeam platform using **Action status.**

## OTA Rollback

You can create a checkpoint in your app to either mark the newly updated firmware image as active or rollback to previous firmware version. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/bytebeamio/bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk/tree/main/examples/basic_ota_rollback" target="_blank">basic\_ota\_rollback</a> example app for reference.

**Note:** For production cases,
&#x20;please tune the checkpoint behavior as per end application requirement.
