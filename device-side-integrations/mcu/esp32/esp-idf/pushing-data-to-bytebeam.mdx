To push data to Bytebeam you need to first create a stream. You can do this by following the [Creating a Stream](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/platform-guide/streams-tables/creating-a-stream) guide.

Once you have created a stream you can use the `publish_to_bytebeam_stream` function to publish data to the stream.

```cpp

// Publish data to a bytebeam stream
// bytebeam_client: Bytebeam client object
// stream: Name of the stream to publish to
// payload: Data to be published
bytebeam_err_t publish_to_bytebeam_stream(bytebeam_client* bytebeam_client, char* stream, char* payload)
```

Bytebeam expects the payload to be in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> format. Have a look at the  <a href="https://github.com/bytebeamio/esp-bytebeam-sdk/tree/main/examples/push_data" target="_blank">push\_data</a> in the example project for a full fledged example showing how to use this function.
