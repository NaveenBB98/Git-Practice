This section provides step by step instructions on how to set up and start using the [Bytebeam ESP IDF SDK](https://github.com/bytebeamio/bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk) . This SDK can be used with any ESP32 board. The only requirements are WiFi and a working internet connection.

## **Step 1. Integrate Bytebeam SDK with an ESP project**

### Clone Bytebeam ESP IDF SDK

Clone `bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk` using a Git client bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bytebeamio/bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk.git
```

This repository consists of three folders:

1. src: This folder contains source code for various functions that can be used by applications for interacting with Bytebeam platform.
2. examples: This folder contains few example projects showing how you can use the SDK.
3. provisioning: Application to push device config data to file system of device (say SPIFFS).&#x20;

### Provision device with device config data

Each device needs a configuration file to connect to Bytebeam.  Download the configuration file and flash it to SPIFFS by following the below steps:

1. Download the device configuration JSON file from Bytebeam cloud by following the [Provisioning a Device](/platform-guide/device-management/provisioning-a-device) guide.
2. After downloading the config file, rename it to the **device\_config.json**
3. Step into **config\_data** folder within the **provisioning** project and place **device\_config.json** file within this folder i.e Replace the file if it is already there.
4. Launch the ESP-IDF terminal and run the following command's.

```shell
# Make sure idf.py tool is accessible
$ idf.py --version

# Step into provisoning project
$ cd path_to_provisioning_project

# Set the target (say esp32)
$ idf.py set-target esp32

# Configure the provisioning project (say partition table setting)
$ idf.py menuconfig

# Clear the entire flash
$ idf.py erase-flash

# Build, Flash and Monitor
$ idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

### Add Bytebeam ESP IDF SDK to the CMake Build System of ESP project

Once the device is provisioned, integrate the `bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk` into your existing ESP project:

- Open top-level `CMakeLists.txt` from your ESP project in an editor.
- Add `bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk`  component to your project by setting `EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`&#x20;

```none
set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS "<path-to-bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk>")
```

This command needs to be after the `cmake_minimum_required()` command. Look at the example project for reference.

- Open project-level `CMakeLists.txt` from your ESP project in an editor.
- Add `bytebeam-esp-idf-sdk` component to your project `PRIV_REQUIRES`

## **Step 2. Configure Hardware**

To connect your ESP device to Bytebeam cloud and exchange data, you need to configure wifi and partition settings. Follow the below steps to configure your project :)

Launch the ESP-IDF terminal and run the following command's.

```shell
# Make sure idf.py tool is accessible
$ idf.py --version

# Step into project
$ cd path_to_project

# Set the target (say esp32)
$ idf.py set-target esp32

# Configure your project
$ idf.py menuconfig
```

### Configure Wifi/Ethernet

1. Configure Wi-Fi/Ethernet settings by selecting **Example Connection Configuration** option.
2. Enter your WiFi SSID and Password.
3. Press `ESC` to exit out of the menu

### Configure Partition table settings

This is required for implementing Over the air updates. The below steps partition your ESP flash into two app partitions and one partition for storing the device config file.

1. Copy `examples_partition.csv` file from example project and paste it into your ESP project.
2. Open menuconfig and select **Partition Table** option.
3. Select **Custom partition table CSV** option from the available options and press `ESC` button.
4. Set the name of Custom partition table CSV to partitions\_example.csv and press` ESC` button. &#x20;

**Note:** With above partition table selected, flash size of 4MB or more is recommended.

## **Step 3: Initialize and start bytebeam client**

The next step is to initialhe below code to do so:

```cpp
// Add this include to your file
#include "bytebeam_sdk.h"

// Declare and initialise bytebeam client object.
bytebeam_client_t bytebeam_client;

void app_main(void)
{
    // Initialise esp
    // Make sure you initialise the network as well as ntp before stepping ahead
    
    // setting up the device info i.e to be seen in the device shadow
    bytebeam_client.device_info.status           = "Device is Up!";
    bytebeam_client.device_info.software_type    = "setup-client-app";
    bytebeam_client.device_info.software_version = "1.0.0";
    bytebeam_client.device_info.hardware_type    = "ESP32 DevKit V1";
    bytebeam_client.device_info.hardware_version = "rev1";
    
    // initialize the bytebeam client        
	bytebeam_init(&bytebeam_client);

    // start the bytebeam client
    bytebeam_start(&bytebeam_client);

    /* Use the bytebeam_stop api to stop the bytebeam client at any point of time in th
     * the code, Also you can mantain the bytebeam client start and bytebeam client 
     * stop flow as per you application needs
     */
    // bytebeam_stop(&bytebeam_client);

    /* Use the bytebeam_destroy api to destroy the bytebeam client at any point of time 
     * in the code, Also you can mantain the bytebeam cient init and bytebeam client     
     * destroy flow as per you application needs
     */
    // bytebeam_destroy(&bytebeam_client);

}
```

Look at the [setup\_client](https://github.com/bytebeamio/esp-bytebeam-sdk/tree/main/examples/setup_client) example app for reference.

## **Step 4: Build and Flash application**

You can build and flash your application as usual with `idf.py` .&#x20;

```shell
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```
