Device Shadow is a special stream that is created by default with every new project on Bytebeam. Device shadow is a digital clone of your Device. By default, it has one field called **Status** representing the status of the device. You can add other important parameters that help you keep track of the state of the device to this Stream.

You can see the latest data pushed on the device shadow stream from the [Device Management](/platform-guide/device-management/introduction) page:
