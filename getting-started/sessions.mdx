Sessions in the Bytebeam console is designed to help you monitor and analyze session-based data. Sessions represent periods of activity defined by user-configured conditions and provide valuable insights into behavior patterns and performance metrics.  

You can easily identify anomalies, patterns, or performance issues by monitoring session information in real-time or within historical data.
