Simplify the process of collect, store & visualize your data for better Device Management and Remote debugging with Bytebeam Cloud.

The first step to getting started with Bytebeam Cloud is to create an Account. You can do this by logging in to [cloud.bytebeam.io](https://cloud.bytebeam.io) using any of these accounts: Google, Linkedin, Microsoft, or Github.

<Note>
Upon logging in, you may encounter one of the following scenarios:

**Existing Project:** If you already have a project, you will be directed to the Device Management page for that project.

**No Project Created:** If no project exists, you'll see a **Welcome** screen that suggests you to either create a new project or try the demo of the Bytebeam console.

**Multiple Projects:** If you have multiple projects, youâ€™ll be presented with a list to select the project you wish to access.

</Note>

**Welcome** screen looks like this:
