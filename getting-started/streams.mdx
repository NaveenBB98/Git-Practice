Streams are how you push data to Bytebeam console. A stream represents a series of time-series data points.&#x20;

For example, if your device has a GPS sensor you will probably be collecting data packets containing latitude, longitude, timestamp, etc periodically. You can create a GPS stream on Bytebeam and push this data to the stream.

By default Bytebeam expects every stream to have at least three fields:

- `id`  to represent device id
- `timestamp` to represent the timestamp at which the event happened
- `sequence` an auto-incrementing number used to ensure all data has been transmitted correctly to the cloud.

You can learn more about stream here:
