## Overview
Action Timeout allows you to set a timeout period for actions on a device if they remain stuck in any state other than "Completed" or "Failed."

## Why Use Action Timeouts?
In certain situations, an action may get stuck in a particular state, preventing subsequent actions from executing. By setting an action timeout, you can mark these stuck actions as "Failed" to free up the device for future tasks.

## Timeout Configuration Options
Timeouts can be configured in three places:

**Action Types** - Specific to individual action types.

**Global Settings** - Applies to all action types.

**Advanced Settings** - Global for all action types but only affects actions in the "Scheduled" state.

## Action Types Timeout
Set timeouts for individual action types, applicable if theyâ€™re stuck in any state other than "Scheduled," "Failed," or "Completed."

To set a timeout for an action type: 

<Steps> 
<Step title="Access Settings Tab"> Navigate to the Settings tab by clicking on your username at the top right. </Step> 
<Step title="Go to Action Types and Edit"> Go to [Action Types](/platform-guide/action-types/action-types) and click on the edit icon next to the action type you want to update. </Step> 
<Step title="Set Timeout"> In the Timeout dropdown, select a duration from the list or set a custom time, then click Submit. </Step> 
</Steps>

## Global Timeout
The global timeout applies to all action types that are stuck in any state other than "Scheduled," "Failed," or "Completed."

<Note>The default global timeout for new projects is set to 30 days.</Note>

To configure the global timeout: 

<Steps> 
<Step title="Access Settings Tab"> Navigate to the Settings tab by clicking on your username at the top right. </Step> 
<Step title="Edit Global Timeout"> Go to the [General](/platform-guide/general-settings) tab, and click the edit icon next to Default Action Timeout. </Step> 
<Step title="Set Timeout"> Select a duration from the Timeout dropdown, or set a custom time, then click the Save icon. </Step> 
</Steps>

## Advanced Settings Timeout
This timeout applies globally to all action types but only affects actions that are stuck in the "Scheduled" state.

Use Case: If you have a phased action with a success-rate dependency, and a prior phase does not meet its criteria, the next phase may get stuck in "Scheduled." This timeout will help mark those phases as "Failed" to allow progression.

<Note>The default for scheduled actions is set to "Never".</Note>

To set a timeout for scheduled actions using Advanced Settings: 

<Steps> 
<Step title="Access Advanced Settings"> In the Advanced Settings section, enable the Advanced Settings Toggle. </Step> 
<Step title="Set Timeout"> Choose a timeout value from the dropdown, or set a custom time, then trigger the action. </Step> 
</Steps>

## Summary of Timeout Precedence
For actions stuck in any state other than "Scheduled," "Completed," or "Failed," the timeout is checked in this order:

1. Action Types Timeout (if configured)

2. Global Timeout (if action types timeout is not configured)

For actions in the "**Scheduled**" state, only the **Advanced Settings Timeout** applies, overriding any Action Types or Global timeouts.

This approach ensures that actions can proceed smoothly without getting indefinitely delayed in unresponsive states.
