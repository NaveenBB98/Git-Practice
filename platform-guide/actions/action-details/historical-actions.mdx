## Filters for Historical Actions
Locating a specific historical action can be tricky when there are numerous actions. The Bytebeam console provides a Filters option to streamline this process.

To apply filters to find a specific historical action, follow these steps:

<Steps> 
<Step title="Access Actions Tab"> Click on the **Actions** tab at the top. </Step> 
<Step title="Navigate to Action Detail Page"> Select an action from the **Actions List** and click on the **View Details** button at the top. </Step> 
<Step title="Go to Device Overview"> Click on the **Eye** icon next to any device in the Devices List. </Step> 
<Step title="Select Filter Options"> Choose from Action Ids, Creators, or Action Types and select the appropriate option from the dropdown. </Step> 
<Step title="Apply the Filter"> Click the dropdown to apply the filter. </Step> 
</Steps>
Once applied, the selected filters will appear at the top with the corresponding keys and values.
<Note>You can use a combination of filters to narrow down your search to specific historical actions.</Note>
