Actions provides a centralized interface where you can initiate new actions and manage all ongoing and historical actions with detailed status updates.

The Action Details section enables you to monitor live action progress and perform operations such as cancelling, retrying, or marking actions as complete. 

Here, youâ€™ll find a comprehensive overview of each action, including the device list, historical actions on specific devices, and filter options for efficient action management.
