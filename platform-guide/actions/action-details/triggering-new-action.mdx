## Steps to Trigger an OTA Update

<Steps> 
<Step title="Access New Action Tab"> Click on **Actions** tab and navigate to the **New Action** tab located at the top </Step> 
<Step title="Select Devices"> Locate devices using pagination if necessary. Select individual devices by checking the boxes next to each one, or select all visible devices by using the **Select All** checkbox. 
<Note>To refine results, apply filters using metadata keys or Device IDs, and then select the filtered devices.</Note> </Step> 
<Step title="Initiate Firmware Update"> Select the action type as **Update Firmware** from the **Action Type dropdown**. From the options, choose the **Firmware Version** or **Firmware Bundle Version** (if Device Components is enabled) or upload **New Firmware Version** </Step> 
<Step title="Fill Details"> Select the devices along with other options such as adding [phases](#phase-wise), enabling [auto retry](#auto-retry) or [abort phase](#abort-phase), choosing [timeout](/platform-guide/actions/action-details/device-level-timeouts) duration etc., check the **Summary** section at the bottom and click on **Trigger Action** button.</Step> 

</Steps>

<Warning>If using the same filter across multiple phases, make sure the total of all phase fractions equals 100%.</Warning>


# <a id="phase-wise"></a>Phasewise Execution of Actions
You can schedule the action in multiple phases, with each phase targeting a specific number or percentage of devices. This enables more controlled rollouts and monitoring.

## Phase Triggering Options
**Success Percentage of Previous Phase** - Start the next phase based on a success rate (percentage of devices that completed the previous phase successfully).

**Custom Timing** - Set custom timing for when each phase should begin.

In addition, you can abort a phase if a certain percentage of devices in the previous phase encounter failures.
<Note>The **Success Percentage** and **Abort Phase** options become visible starting from the second phase.</Note>
## <a id="abort-phase"></a>Abort Phase
To enable Abort Phase in any of the phases starting from second phase,
<Steps> 
<Step title="Access Abort Phase"> Scroll down to the **Abort Phase** section, enable the **Abort Phase Toggle**. </Step> 
<Step title="Set Percentage"> Enter a percentage value, then trigger the action. </Step> 
</Steps>


## <a id="auto-retry"></a>Auto Retry
Enable Auto Retry to automatically retry failed actions due to temporary issues, eliminating the need for manual retries.
To enable Auto Retry option for any action, 
<Steps> 
<Step title="Access Advanced Settings"> Scroll down to the **Advanced Settings** section, enable the **Advanced Settings Toggle**. </Step> 
<Step title="Enable the toggle"> Enable the **Auto Retry Toggle**. </Step> 
</Steps>

## Device List Upload

<Warning>This feature is available only in Actions/New Action currently and is not available in Device Management</Warning>
If you prefer not to select devices manually for each phase, you can upload a CSV file containing the phase details along with associated metadata keys and values for each device.

To use the Device List upload feature:

<Steps> 
<Step title="Access Device List Upload Section"> Scroll down to the **Device List** section and click on it.</Step> 
<Step title="Upload Device List File"> Upload a CSV/XLSX file with all the phase details containing metadata keys and values. </Step> 
<Step title="Review the Device List"> Review the device list generated from the upload, and deselect any devices as needed.</Step>
</Steps>
You can proceed with triggering the action on the finalized device list.

# Important Update

When triggering an action on a device with ongoing actions, a warning modal will appear. From this modal, you can choose one of the following options:

**Complete Actions on Selected Devices and Proceed** - This option marks all ongoing actions on the device as complete and immediately starts the new action.

**Proceed Anyway with New Action** - This option queues the new action to begin only once all current actions on the device have either completed or failed.
