title: Introduction to Action Types
---

## What are action types?

Action types are commands that can be executed on a device directly from the Bytbeam console. These actions must be predefined in the device firmware. 
## Uses of action types

They can be used for tasks such as updating firmware or changing device configurations remotely, as well as for custom commands like shutting down the device.
