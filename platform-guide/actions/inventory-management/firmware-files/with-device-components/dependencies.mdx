title: Dependency of Versions between Components

## Why Are Version Dependencies Needed Between Components?
In many devices, certain components depend on specific versions of other components to function correctly. When updating the firmware of one component, itâ€™s essential to check that other interdependent components are running compatible versions.

For instance, you might set a dependency between the Motor and Engine components, so that if the Engine is upgraded to version 3, the Motor must be on at least version 2 for the device to operate as expected.


You can add a version dependency for a component while uploading the new firmware version by following the below steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Actions Tab">
    Click on the **Actions** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Inventory Tab and Access Firmware Files Tab">
    Navigate to the **Firmware Files** tab by clicking on Inventory section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to the desired Device Component Tab and Initiate Upload">
    Click on **Firmware Files** tab, click on the desired **Device Component** tab and click on **Upload New Firmware** button
</Step>
<Step title="Fill Details">
    Enter details like version, upload the firmware file, enter uncompressed file size(Optional).
</Step>
<Step title="Click on Add Dependencies">
    Click on **Add Dependencies** button and select the components and corresponding versions and click on **Submit** button.
</Step>
</Steps>
