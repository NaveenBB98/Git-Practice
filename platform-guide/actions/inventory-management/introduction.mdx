Inventory is a place where you store all the firmware files, json configuration and geofence configuration versions.

  ## What Are Firmware Files?
Firmware files are incremental updates to the software that runs on a device. 

Each firmware file has an associated version number which is used to to track changes and improvements (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v2.0.0). These numbers help to identify the version running on a device and determine if an upgrade is necessary.

Keeping firmware up to date is essential for device security, functionality, and compatibility with other systems.

  <Tab title="📄 JSON Configurations" icon="file-code">
    ## What are JSON Configurations?

When configuring IoT devices, JSON is often used to define and send settings like operational parameters, thresholds, user preferences, or communication protocols, ensuring devices function as expected.

## Uses of JSON Configurations

JSON configurations make managing IoT devices highly efficient, letting users deploy updates, change settings, and keep devices in sync with minimal manual effort. 

For instance, updating a configuration like `{"device_id": "1234", "firmware_version": "v2.1"}` across all devices ensures they operate on the latest version without manual intervention.

  <Tab title="🌐 Geofence Configurations">
    ## What are Geofence Configurations?
    A geofence is a virtual boundary set around a specific geographic area, often defined by GPS coordinates and a geofence config contains the coordinate information like latitude, longitude etc.

## Uses of Geofence Configurations

In IoT, geofencing is used for location-based automation. For instance, an IoT device can send alerts or adjust its behavior based on its location relative to a geofence, which is commonly used in asset tracking, security, and fleet management applications.
