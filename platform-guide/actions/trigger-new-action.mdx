**Step 3**: At this stage, you have the choice between initiating a phased rollout or proceeding without phases. For each phase, a device filter is provided, enabling you to choose specific devices for action triggers. Additionally, you can set the timing for each phase to determine when the actions will be triggered. You can also, select the percentage of devices if all devices are selected in a filter.
