## What Are No-Signal Alerts?
No-signal alerts are alerts which get triggered when expected data stops arriving from a particular source or stream. 

Unlike traditional signal-based alerts, which are based on specific conditions like thresholds or values, no-signal alerts monitor the continuity of data. They are designed to notify you when a data stream that is expected to be active is not receiving any updates, indicating a potential issue with the data flow or source.

## Uses of No-Signal Alerts
The key purpose of no-signal alerts is to monitor the availability and health of data streams in real-time. 

These alerts are critical in IoT systems, where continuous data flow is essential for monitoring device performance, user activity, or sensor readings. 

When a stream stops unexpectedly, it could signal a malfunction, network issue, or system failure, and immediate action may be required.
