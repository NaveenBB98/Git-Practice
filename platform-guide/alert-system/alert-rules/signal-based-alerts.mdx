## What Are Signal-Based Alerts?
Signal-based alerts are triggered when certain conditions or thresholds within your data stream are met. 

These alerts are typically defined by specific criteria, such as exceeding a value, crossing a threshold, or when the data satisfies a predefined condition. Signal-based alerts are highly customizable, allowing you to set precise conditions to monitor the health and performance of your systems.

## Uses of Signal-Based Alerts
Signal-based alerts are used to monitor specific, actionable events in real-time. By setting thresholds or conditions, you can be notified immediately when important changes occur in your data.

For instance, in an industrial setting, you may set a signal-based alert if the temperature of a machine exceeds a critical threshold, ensuring that operators can act quickly to prevent equipment failure.
