title: Introduction to Alerts and Notifications
---

Alerts and notifications play a pivotal role in the dynamic world of IoT by delivering timely insights and keeping users informed of key events, thresholds, and changes within the IoT ecosystem.

You can set up alerts to trigger notifications for specific events or conditions, like a sudden temperature spike, a device going offline, or an unusual data pattern. 

You decide the conditions, and weâ€™ll make sure youâ€™re notified across your preferred channelsâ€”whether itâ€™s email, SMS, messaging apps, or webhooks. 

This way, youâ€™re always in the loop, able to respond quickly, and stay in control of your IoT environment.

Alert rules let you define the conditions that matter most. You can create rules that trigger alerts based on specific signals, such as when data crosses a set threshold, or set up no-signal alerts to notify you if a data stream goes silent. 

With flexible options for customizing each rule, youâ€™re in control of how and when youâ€™re alerted, ensuring youâ€™re always aware of important changes or potential issues in your system.

## Alert Groups
Alert groups make it simple to organize and manage your alert rules, giving you a clear, streamlined view on the dashboard. By grouping related alerts, you can quickly see patterns, track issues by category, and focus on whatâ€™s most importantâ€”all from one place. 

This organized approach enhances visibility, helping you keep a pulse on critical events and respond swiftly to any changes in your IoT environment.

You can add a group for the alert while creating the alert itslef.
You can even edit the existing alert rule and change the alert group in that to move the alert rule into a specified alert group.

<Warning>The alert group disappears when all the alert rules written in it are either deleted or moved to some other alert group</Warning>
<Note>All the existing alert rules are grouped under Default alert group.</Note>

Following are the two types of alerts that you can configure in Bytebeam console:

<Card title="No Signal Alerts" icon="ban" href="/platform-guide/alert-system/alert-rules/no-signal-alerts"> No-signal alerts are designed to notify you when expected data goes missing. They activate when a data stream unexpectedly stops, signaling a potential issue with connectivity, device status, or data flow. </Card> 
<Card title="Signal Based Alerts" icon="signal" href="/platform-guide/alert-system/alert-rules/signal-based-alerts"> Signal-based alerts keep you informed whenever key conditions are met in your data streams. These alerts are triggered by specific thresholds or parameters you set, such as temperature limits, sensor readings, or activity levels </Card> 
</CardGroup>

<Tab title="ðŸ”” Notification Rules">
Notification rules let you decide how and where you want to be alerted when an event occurs. Once an alert is triggered, notification rules determine which channelsâ€”like email, Slack, SMS, WhatsApp, or webhooksâ€”will deliver the message.

## Alert Templates

The alert template for Email, Slack and Webhook channels looks like this:

```json JSON
{% for alert in alerts -%}
    {{ alert.name }} triggered at {{ alert.start_time }} on device {{ alert.device.id }}
From ByteBeam
    {% if not loop.last %}

    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```
With alert template, you can get the data of device like Metadata, Device Shadow, Status, Start Time, End Time, Last Action Details, Activation Values & Deactivation Values. You can customize the template for the above mentioned channels to see the corresponding data in the notification message.
