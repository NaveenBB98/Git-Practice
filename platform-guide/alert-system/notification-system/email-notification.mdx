## Overview
Email notification rules allow you to send alerts to specified email addresses when conditions or thresholds in your data streams are met.

These real-time updates keep you informed about critical changes or events, even when you're away from the platform. For example, an email notification can be triggered when a machine's temperature exceeds a critical threshold, alerting maintenance staff to take action.
