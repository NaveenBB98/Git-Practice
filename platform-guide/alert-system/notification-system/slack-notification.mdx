## Overview
Slack notification rules allow you to send alerts to a specific Slack channel when conditions or thresholds in your data streams are met.

These real-time updates help your team stay informed about critical changes or events that require immediate attention, enabling quick responses and coordination. For example, a Slack notification can be triggered when a machine's temperature exceeds a critical threshold, allowing the team to act swiftly to prevent failure.
