## Overview
SMS notification rules allow you to send real-time alerts to a specified phone number(s) when conditions or thresholds in your data streams are met.

Ideal for quick updates on mobile devices, SMS notifications ensure personnel can respond to critical events even when away from a computer. For example, an SMS notification can alert maintenance staff when a machine's temperature exceeds a critical threshold, enabling immediate action.
