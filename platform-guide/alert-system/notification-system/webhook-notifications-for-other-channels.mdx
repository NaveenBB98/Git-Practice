## Overview
Webhook notification rules allow you to send real-time alerts to a specified URL when conditions or thresholds in your data streams are met.

Used to integrate Bytebeam with external services, webhook notifications automate workflows by allowing you to customize the request body and headers with key-value pairs. For example, a webhook notification can send data to a monitoring service when a device goes offline, triggering automated recovery actions.
