The Compare Dashboard feature allows users to analyze and compare data across devices or different time ranges. Follow these steps to use this feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Dashboards">
    Go to the **Dashboards** tab in the Bytebeam console and open the dashboard you want to compare.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Compare Feature">
    Inside the dashboard, click on the **Compare** button located in the dashboard toolbar. This will open the comparison view in a new tab.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Device Dashboard Comparison">
    - If the dashboard is a **Device Dashboard**, the comparison view will display two partitioned windows side by side.
    - You can select one device on the **left side** and another device on the **right side** to compare dashboards for different devices simultaneously.
    - Alternatively, you can select the **same device** on both sides and modify the time range independently on each side to analyze data for the same device over different time periods.

    - Clicking on dashboard links within the comparison view will open the linked dashboards in a new tab, retaining the comparison mode.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fleet Dashboard Comparison">
    - If the dashboard is a **Fleet Dashboard**, the comparison view will directly open the dashboard in two partitioned windows in a new tab.
    - If the original fleet dashboard has metadata filters, you can select different devices for each partition to compare data across devices.
    - You can also keep the same devices as in original dashboard for both partitions and adjust the time ranges independently to compare data for the same device over different periods.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
- In the **Device Dashboard**, the comparison feature is most useful for analyzing multiple devices or time ranges for a single device.
- In the **Fleet Dashboard**, ensure that metadata filters are properly configured to allow seamless device selection for comparisons.
