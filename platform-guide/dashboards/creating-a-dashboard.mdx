    Provide the necessary information in the following sections:

    - **General**:
      - **Title**: A name for the dashboard.
      - **Dashboard Type**: Choose between **Fleet Dashboard** and **Device Dashboard**.

    - **Device Metadata**:  
      - **Allow filtering by**: Select from a list of device metadata options to enable filtering in the dashboard.

      For Device Dashboard: Displays only the devices that meet the selected filter conditions in the Devices List page.

      For Fleet Dashboard: Shows data specifically for devices that satisfy the filter conditions, applying these filters to panels as they are added.

    - **Show Metadata** (Available only for Device Dashboards):  
      - **Allow Viewing**: Show the selected metadata keys and corresponding values for selected device in the dashboard.

    - **Time Range**:
      - **Default Time Range**: Sets the default recency for the data displayed on the dashboard.
      - Optionally, enable or disable the ability for users to change the time range.

    - **Refresh Interval**:  
      - Set an interval (in seconds) to refresh the dashboard data automatically.

    - **Dashboard Links**: 
      - Select additional dashboards from the dropdown list to open in a new tab while remaining on the current dashboard.
      - The selected dashboards will be displayed within the current dashboard, allowing you to open the corresponding dashboard in a new tab by clicking on them.

    - **Access Control**:
      - **Owners**: Define who can modify the dashboard.
      - **Viewers**: Define who can view the dashboard.  
      Refer to [Sharing a Dashboard](/platform-guide/dashboards/sharing-a-dashboard) for more details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Redirected to Dashboard or Device List Page">
