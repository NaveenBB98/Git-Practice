title: Introduction to Dashboards
---

## Overview

Dashboards are dynamic and interactive visual displays of real-time or historical data. They consist of panels such as line charts, last value displays, time series graphs, and even device locators, allowing users to monitor and analyze device performance and behavior effectively.

You can create dashboards by selecting [panels](/platform-guide/dashboards/panels/introduction-to-panels) that stream live data from the devices or process historical data stored in the system.

## Use Cases of Dashboards

Following are some of the use cases for Dashboards:

1. Real-Time Monitoring for Quick Decision-Making
Example: A factory manager can use a line chart panel to monitor equipment temperatures in real time. If the temperature exceeds the safe limit, they can act immediately to prevent downtime or accidents.

2. Comprehensive Insights with Historical Data
Example: A timeseries panel helps visualize the energy consumption patterns of a smart building over the last week, enabling energy-saving decisions based on peak usage hours.

3. Locate and Manage Devices Efficiently
Example: A delivery company can use the locate devices panel to track the real-time location of GPS-enabled vehicles, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient routing.

## Types of Dashboards to Create

**1. Device Dashboards**

Device dashboards are tailored to monitor and analyze data from individual devices. These dashboards provide a detailed view of a single device's performance, status, and metrics, enabling users to focus on its specific behavior.

**Use Case:** A user can create a device dashboard for a smart thermostat to track temperature readings, energy usage, and connectivity status in real-time.

**Panels:** These dashboards often include panels like line charts, last value, time series tables etc. for precise device-level insights.

**2. Fleet Dashboards**

Fleet dashboards are designed for managing and monitoring a group of devices collectively. They provide a holistic view of the performance and status of multiple devices, enabling efficient operations and comparison.

**Use Case:** A fleet dashboard for a logistics company can track GPS locations, fuel consumption, and delivery statuses for all vehicles in the fleet.

**Panels:** Fleet dashboards typically feature locate devices, track devices, device pulse panel etc. to monitor and manage large-scale deployments.
