The Aggregate Value Panel is designed to display aggregated metrics from selected streams, offering a summary of data through operations such as sum, average, maximum, and minimum. 

This panel is ideal for visualizing the overall performance or health of systems based on aggregated values, such as total usage, average temperature, or other key metrics that require aggregation across time or categories.
