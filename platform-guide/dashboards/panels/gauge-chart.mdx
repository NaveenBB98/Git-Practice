The Gauge Chart Panel is designed to display a single data point in the form of a gauge, providing an easy-to-read visual representation of the data's current value relative to defined thresholds. This panel is ideal for visualizing metrics where you need to track performance within a specific range, such as system health, resource utilization, or other indicators that can be represented by a progress bar or dial.

You can set minimum and maximum threshold values, and the gauge will dynamically adjust based on the value of the selected metric, giving you a clear indication of whether the metric is within the desired range.
