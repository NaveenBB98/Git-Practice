## Overview
Panels are the building blocks of dashboards, allowing users to visualize specific data streams in various formats, such as line charts, last value displays, time series graphs, or device locators. 

Each panel is customizable and represents a focused view of a particular metric, enabling users to track real-time or historical data effectively.
