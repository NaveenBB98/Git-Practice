The LED Panel is a highly intuitive way to visualize the current state (Active/Inactive) of devices or components. Each "LED" represents a field, allowing real-time monitoring of multiple devices or parameters. 

**Use Cases:**
- Display whether a device or component is online (active) or offline (inactive).
- Indicate the status of sensors, machines, or other equipment.
