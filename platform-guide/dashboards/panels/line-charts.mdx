The Line Chart Panel is designed to visualize data trends over time. By plotting data points and connecting them with lines, it provides an intuitive way to track changes and patterns in real-time or historical data. 

Ideal for monitoring metrics like sensor readings, system performance, or usage statistics, the line chart panel offers rich customization options to tailor the visualization to specific needs.
