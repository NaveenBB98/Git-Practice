The State Timeline Panel is a powerful tool for visualizing state changes over time. It is particularly useful in applications where monitoring transitions or durations of different states is critical. Examples include:

- Monitoring machine or device states such as "on," "off," or "error."
- Tracking operational modes like "idle," "active," or "maintenance."
- Visualizing user actions or events over time.

The panel offers a clear and interactive way to explore temporal patterns and provides an option to dynamically change the dashboard's timerange based on a specific state selection.
