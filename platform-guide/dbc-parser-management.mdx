### **DBC Parser Management**

Our platform provides robust DBC parser management for streamlining the integration and analysis of data from the CAN-based IoT devices.

**What is a DBC Parser?**

A DBC parser is a software tool that decodes the messages transmitted on your IoT device's Controller Area Network (CAN) bus.  DBC files (Diagnostic Bus Configuration) define the structure, signals (meaningful data units), and scaling factors within these messages. The DBC parser references this file to interpret raw CAN data into clear, actionable information.

### **Creating a DBC Parser**

The DBC Parser Management feature allows you to create parsers for  decoding CAN bus data from your IoT devices. Follow these steps to configure a new DBC parser:

1. Click "Add DBC Parser"
2. Enter a Descriptive Name
3. Specify the DBC Version
4. Set the Input Stream
5. Define the Cycle Time
6. Upload a DBC File
7. Click "Submit" to Create the Parser.

After creating the parser, you can start/stop the parser, or download the DBC file from the list.
