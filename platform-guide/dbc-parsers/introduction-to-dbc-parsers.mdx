## Overview

A DBC parser is a software tool that decodes the messages transmitted on your IoT device's Controller Area Network (CAN) bus.  DBC files define the structure, signals (meaningful data units), and scaling factors within these messages. The DBC parser references this file to interpret raw CAN data into clear, actionable information.

## Use of DBC Parsers

You can use DBC parsers to track and analyze vehicle data for real-time monitoring and reporting.
For instance, a logistics company can use a DBC parser to decode GPS data, engine RPM, and load information from trucks. This data can be displayed on a dashboard, helping managers track shipments and make data-driven decisions on routing and fuel efficiency.
