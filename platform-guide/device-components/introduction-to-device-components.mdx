title: Introduction to Device Components
---

## Overview

Each IoT device is made up of multiple components, each of which can be updated independently. This modular approach allows for targeted updates, enhancing control over the device's configuration.
## Use of Device Components

With the device components feature, you can create individual components and upload their respective firmwares along with any dependencies between them. You can then create a firmware bundle which can be used to update all components simultaneously by triggering a single action.
