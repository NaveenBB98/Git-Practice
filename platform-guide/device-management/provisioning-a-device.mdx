Provisioning is the initial process of setting up a device so it can communicate securely with the Bytebeam platform. During provisioning, unique identifiers, credentials, and configuration settings are generated and assigned to the device. This process includes:

**Registering the Device**: Adding the device to the Bytebeam console with its metadata and configuration details.

**Configuring Security Credentials**: Generating a configuration file that includes the necessary security credentials, such as certificates and keys, to securely authenticate the device with the platform.

**Connecting to the Cloud**: Once provisioned, the device uses the configuration file to establish a secure connection to the Bytebeam platform.

To provision a device in Bytebeam console,

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Device Management Tab">
    Click on the **Device Management** tab at the top
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on Create Device Button">
    Click on the **Create Device** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the desired values for Metadata Keys">
    Enter the values for **Metadata Keys** or Optionally, you can also&#x20;

- Skip adding Metadata Key values
- Choose to create a duplicate device by unchecking the "Do not create duplicate device" option
and finally click on **Submit** button to create the device.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>

The device configuration file should be downloaded automatically onto your computer. The contents of the file will look similar to this:
```json JSON
{
  "project_id": "demo",
  "broker": "cloud.bytebeam.io",
  "port": 8883,
  "device_id": "1230",
  "authentication": {
    "ca_certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\n...certificate contents...",
    "device_certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\n...certificate contents...",
    "device_private_key": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\\n...key contents..."
  }
}
```

</Note>
