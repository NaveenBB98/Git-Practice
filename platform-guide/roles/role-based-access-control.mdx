title: Role Based Access Control
---

## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security mechanism that restricts access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. RBAC enhances system security by enforcing access permissions based on predefined user roles, ensuring that users only have the permissions necessary for their role.

## Uses of Role Based Access Control:

For instance, consider a user who only manages dashboards without needing to trigger any actions on devices. In this case, an admin can create a role that provides access solely to dashboards and streams and then this role can be assigned to the user.
