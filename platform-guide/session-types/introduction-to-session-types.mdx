title: Introduction to Session Types
---

## Overview

Session types define the rules for sessions, which are crucial for tracking the operating states of IoT devices, indicating whether a device is active, idle, or in a custom state.

## Use of Session Types

For example, in vehicles, sessions can show if a car is "running" or "stopped," providing clear insights into its current status. By setting specific conditions while creating session types, you can control when a device starts or ends a session, allowing for better monitoring and management.
