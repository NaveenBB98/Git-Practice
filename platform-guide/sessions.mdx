Sessions provide a structured way to represent the operational states or modes of a device. For instance, for vehicles, sessions can help determine if a vehicle is in a "running" or "stopped" state. By leveraging the power of conditions, users can accurately define when a device enters or exits a session. Furthermore, sessions enhance the visualization capabilities of the dashboard, allowing users to quickly assess the current state of a device and review its historical session data.
