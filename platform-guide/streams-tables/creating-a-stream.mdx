Streams (Data Tables) are essential in IoT, enabling real-time processing and analysis of data from connected devices, sensors, and systems.

Before streams can be used to build panels in dashboards, they must first be created in the Settings/Streams section. The stream name must match the actual stream produced by the device.

## Important Info

<Note>Make sure the stream name on the platform matches the actual stream name generated by the device.</Note>

<Note>
  The **Timestamp** and **Sequence** fields are automatically added to every Stream by default. 

  - The **Timestamp** indicates when an event occurred, while the **Sequence** is an auto-increment field pushed by the device. It is used internally to ensure all data sent by the device has reached the server.
</Note>

<Note>By default **device_shadow** and **action_status** streams get created for every new project</Note>
