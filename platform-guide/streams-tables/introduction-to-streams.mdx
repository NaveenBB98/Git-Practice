## Overview

Streams, also known as Data Tables, are a fundamental component in IoT. They enable the real-time processing and analysis of data coming from connected devices, sensors, and systems, making it possible to monitor and interpret data as it’s generated.

## Uses of Streams
Streams are used to collect and process real-time data from IoT devices, which can then be visualized in dashboards for monitoring and analysis. For instance, you can create separate streams for temperature and GPS data, which enables you to monitor each truck’s temperature and location in real-time.
