title: Introduction to Users in Projects
---

Every project can have multiple users, each assigned a specific role. 

For instance, consider a user who only manages dashboards without needing to trigger any actions on devices. In this case, an admin can create a role that provides access solely to dashboards and streams and assign this role to the user. This way, the user will only see the relevant sections needed for their work.
