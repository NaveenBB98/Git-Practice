### Ability to pin metadata in device management

The metadata fields have a new feature that allows them to be pinned, ensuring their immediate visibility at the top of the devices list table. By hovering over the metadata name, you can select the Pin icon to easily pin that specific metadata. Up to three metadata fields can be pinned.

### Bar chart panel

We are excited to reintroduce the bar chart panel, which enables you to monitor device data grouped by parameters such as firmware or config version. This powerful tool can also be utilized to track common parameters across multiple devices in the Fleet dashboard.&#x20;

### Text type payload in actions

Previously, there was no way to pass parameters to an action. However, in the preceding releases, we introduced action types that enabled Actions with custom JSON payloads. In our latest release, we are introducing **text-type actions**, which allow you to pass plain text as a payload to the action.
