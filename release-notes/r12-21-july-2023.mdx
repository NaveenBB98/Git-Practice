### **Device Pulse panel enhancements**

Device pulse panel now includes the pulse of all devices, regardless of whether they fall within the specified thresholds. It shows the pulse starting from the last threshold up to the selected time range, and also displays pulse measurements beyond that time range as separate data. In addition, it indicates the total number of devices that have been selected by the applied filters.

Now, when viewing the list of devices for a specific threshold, the device list is paginated, allowing for easier navigation. Furthermore, you have the option to download the metadata of the devices listed.
