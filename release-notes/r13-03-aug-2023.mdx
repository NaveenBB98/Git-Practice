### **Advanced Data Filtering in Line Charts**

We've enhanced our line chart capabilities to now support advanced data filtering. You can add filters based on 'where' conditions on any column value. Plus, you can combine multiple filters using AND or OR conditions. This update provides a more powerful and flexible way to visualize your data.

### **Introduction of GroupBy Feature in Line Charts**

We've enhanced our line chart capabilities by introducing a GroupBy feature. This allows you to group data in the line chart based on column values within the device dashboard. Please note that in the fleet dashboard, data grouping is done by device ID by default. This update provides a more flexible way to analyze and visualize your data.

### **Enhanced JSON Schema Support in Configurations**

We've enhanced our JSON type actions to now accept a JSON Schema. When such an action is triggered, a form will be presented to the user, allowing them to input the corresponding configuration. This update provides a more flexible and user-friendly way to manage your JSON configurations.

### **Geofence Configuration Enhancement**

We've made it easier to set up geofence configurations. You can now do this directly through the maps user interface. The configurations are stored in JSON format and can be activated as an Action on your device. This update provides a more streamlined and efficient way to manage your geofencing needs.
