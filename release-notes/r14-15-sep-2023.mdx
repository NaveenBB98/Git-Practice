### **Save Custom Time Ranges**

In our latest feature update, you can now set and save custom time intervals to view crucial data. No more being tied to pre-set time frames. Whether it's the last 15 minutes or a specific period from last month, save these settings for quick access from the dropdown later. Analyze your data your way, tailored to your unique needs.

### **Column Reordering in TimeSeries Panels**

We've added a new feature to our TimeSeries Panels that allows you to easily reorder columns, putting the most relevant data right where you want it. No more endless scrolling to find the information you needâ€”simply drag and drop columns to customize your table view. This update makes it even more convenient to focus on the data that matters most to you.

### **Enhancing the Save Feature for a More Intuitive Dashboard Experience**

We've introduced a new safeguard to ensure you never lose important data. If you attempt to close your IoT Dashboard with unsaved changes, a warning will now appear to remind you to save your work. Plus, we've made the save button more noticeable and added a subtle animation to draw your attention.&#x20;

### **Highlighting Search Keyword in Log Messages**

Now, when you perform a search in the logs panel, all instances of your search keywords will be highlighted. This makes it easier to spot critical information without having to read through each line of log messages. The highlighted text ensures that you can quickly locate and analyze the data you need.
