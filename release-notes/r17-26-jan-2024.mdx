We've given our Actions page a fresh look, now displaying more details right on the home screen, including a summary of selected actions. This redesign introduces the phased rollout feature, enabling you to initiate actions in multiple stages and target various devices in each stage. It's a great way to test updates on a small group of devices before expanding to a larger scale.

The fleet dashboard has been enhanced with the addition of LED and Last Value panels. These new panels provide a visual representation of data for every device in your fleet, displayed in a grid format to show information for each individual device.

Device management now offers direct access to a device's logs and action history. This feature enables you to review past actions taken on the device and examine device logs for efficient debugging.

### **Mark Historical Actions as complete**

On the device details page, where you can view historical actions, there's now a feature to mark all outstanding actions, which might be hindering new actions, as complete. This effectively clears the queue, allowing other pending actions to proceed.

### **Streamlined Role Creation**

We've made role creation easier and more intuitive with module-level management. Permissions are now neatly organized under corresponding top-level tabs, simplifying navigation. Additionally, we've removed redundant and unnecessary permissions, managing them behind the scenes to minimize complexity and enhance usability.
