We've made a lot of improvements and additions in the open source version of our MQTT broker - [rumqttd](https://github.com/bytebeamio/rumqtt). All of the latest advancements from it have been added to the cloud deployment.

### New internals&#x20;

The internal architecture of rumqttd (broker) has been revamped. Broker internally maintains a commitlog that publishers write to and subscribers read from. The earlier design maintained a copy of the entire commit log for each subscriber.

In this version, there is now only one copy of the commit log per filter for all subscribers to read from. We maintain a read offset for subscribes into the commit log. This drastically reduces memory usage when there are multiple subscribers subscribed on the same filter.​

Read about other changes to broker's internals in our blog post [here](https://bytebeam.io/blog/the-rust-based-mqtt-broker-rumqtt-gets-new-internals-cl8d5ur0u650711mmnqn9elrxg/).

### Improved logging with Distributed Tracing

Tracing support has been added to broker. Every log line emitted by the broker now contains contextual information and machine readable field structure. ​Logs are enriched with information like device id, packet and event types. This means that logs can be used effectively with other programs.

Filtering based on a field like client id, topic, tenants, etc. or changing log levels can be done dynamically instead of restarting broker which would result in loosing old logs.

A demo of tracing and other related changes can be found in our blog post [here](https://bytebeam.io/blog/rumqtt-release-r18-traceability-metering-and-native-tls-support-clati1td2571801kpsqcjku5bj/).

### Bug fixes & Minor changes

- **MQTT v5 experimental support**: Broker supports MQTT v5 for connects, publishes, and subscribes
- **Prometheus integration**: With this the broker exposes metrics on an endpoint your Prometheus instance can scrape directly from
