Our platform now features an innovative enhancement that allows you to designate a specific metadata field as a serial key, seamlessly replacing the device ID throughout the console. This new capability streamlines system management by providing a unified identifier that simplifies tracking and improves traceability. With this update, you can enjoy enhanced flexibility in metadata configuration, reduce administrative overhead, and ensure a consistent user experience across the platform.&#x20;

### Additional settings in DBC Parsers

In the last release, we introduced the DBC Parser, a tool that decodes messages from your IoT device's CAN bus using DBC files to translate raw data into clear, actionable information. This release enhances the parser with optional settings, such as:

- **Appending CAN IDs** to column names for easier identification.
- **Disabling Enum Parsing** for flexible data interpretation.
- Configurable **Upper and Lower Thresholds for Flushing Clusters (ms)** to control data processing timing.
- A **DBC Version Filter** to identify versions in the CAN table.

These improvements provide enhanced flexibility and precision for seamless data analysis.

### CSV/XLSX file upload for selecting devices in multiple phases

We've added a new feature that streamlines device selection when triggering a new action. Now, you can upload a CSV or XLSX file containing a list of devices, either by device ID or serial key metadata, for each phase. This enhancement simplifies the selection process, minimizes manual errors, and makes action initiation faster and more accurate, providing a more efficient workflow overall.

### Customize Logo

### Action Logs
