## Important Update

<Note>The documentation has been updated! Check out the [Beta Version](https://bytebeamio.mintlify.app/getting-started/signup) and share your valuable feedback.</Note>

## Notify on Alert Deactivation

Weâ€™ve introduced a new feature called **Notify on Deactivation**. Previously, users received notifications only when an alert was activated. Now, users can also receive notifications when an alert is deactivated, based on the configured deactivation template.
To use this feature, simply enable the "Notify on Deactivation toggle" while creating or editing notification rules.

**Important Note:**
If you enable this toggle for existing notification rules, you will receive notifications for all the alerts that got deactivated within the last hour for the corresponding alert rule.

## JSON View for Geofence Configurations

Weâ€™ve introduced a new **JSON View** feature for Geofence configurations. Previously, users needed to select a region on the map to define the geofence polygon while creating a geofence configuration.

With this update, users can now directly input a JSON object containing latitude, longitude and enter the details such as alert threshold and version name. This allows for quicker and more precise geofence creation.
Once the geofence configuration is created, users can update their devices with the corresponding geofence version to enable tracking.

## Dashboard Linking for Alerts

Weâ€™ve introduced a new feature that allows users to link dashboards directly to alert rules. While creating an alert rule, you can now include a device or fleet dashboard link. This link will be displayed in the **Alert Rules table**.

Additionally, the linked dashboard is accessible from the **Alerts panel**. Clicking the link in the Alerts panel will redirect you to the corresponding dashboard, with the alert's time range automatically applied for seamless analysis.


## Group by second aggregator

![](/assets/group_by_second_aggregate.png)

For **fleet dashboards**, weâ€™ve introduced a new feature in the **Aggregate Value panel** enabling users to apply a secondary aggregation with grouping. When selecting a primary aggregator (e.g., min) and a secondary aggregator (e.g., max), it creates combinations like max(min).
With the Group by Second Aggregator toggle enabled, the grouping operation is applied to the secondary aggregator. 

**Example:**
- If you select mode as the column and set the primary and secondary aggregators to max and count, it calculates count(max).
- When the toggle is enabled, it groups by mode values (e.g., on and off) and shows the count of devices in each state.

**Note:** This feature is exclusively available in fleet dashboards.

## Disabled Auto-Refresh for Device Shadow Filters

![](/assets/data_persistence_with_device_shadow_filters.png)


Weâ€™ve disabled auto refresh functionality for device shadow filters to enhance usability and stability. Previously, when users applied filters like mode=on, the displayed devices would constantly update due to real-time data changes.

With this update, the filtered data now remains stable, and users have the option to manually refresh the page using the **Refresh** button to update the device shadow data.

**Note:** This feature applies only to device shadow filters and does not support metadata filters, such as City is Bangalore.

## Action Settings in Role Management

![](/assets/action_settings_in_create_role.png)

Weâ€™ve moved the **Action Settings** tab inside Actions and updated the **Create Role modal** by introducing an additional permission option.

**With this enhancement:**

- Admins can now specify whether non-admin users can only view or also create, edit, and delete action types within the tenant.
- Non-admin users will only see the action types for which the admin has granted access.

This update provides more granular control over permissions for action types.
