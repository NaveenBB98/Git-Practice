## Status Bar for Updates

We have introduced a new status bar to provide a unified view of key platform insights. Situated at the bottom of each page, it lets you quickly check **device metrics**, **payment information**, and notifications without changing contexts. On the Device Management page, it shows how many devices are currently active and displays the most recent ‚ÄúData Last Refreshed‚Äù timestamp. 
Once the invoice gets generated, the status bar displays a notification message under notification icon and when the specified date arrives, the message appears on the status bar, ensuring you never miss important renewals. These automatic reminders help you stay on top of subscription renewals and ensures avoiding last-minute rushes or service interruptions. 

## Streams Section Redesign

We‚Äôve redesigned the **Streams** page to improve **performance** and **usability**. Streams are now displayed in an accordion format, allowing you to expand each stream to view its columns, data types, and units. You can easily add new columns using the + icon and remove entire streams with the delete icon. Each column‚Äôs data type and unit can be edited using the edit icon, while individual columns can also be deleted. 
A new **search** feature allows you to find both streams and columns by keyword, with matched results highlighted for better visibility. These updates enable faster loading times and simplify stream management, making it more intuitive and efficient.



## Bug fixes & Minor changes

- **Line Chart:** Fixed the cursor focus issue in the Advanced Settings section of Line Chart in Dashboards.
- **View Payload:** Added the view payload option in the Device list and Last Action sections
