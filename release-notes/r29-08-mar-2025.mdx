## Alerts & Notifications Enhancements

We've made slight improvements to Alerts & Notifications. These updates improve flexibility and clarity in alert handling:
  - Introduced a field in the Create/Edit Notification Rule modal to specify a name for better identification. 
  - You can now include **Alert Instance ID**, **Notification Rule ID**, and **Notification Rule Name** in your templates. See the image for reference and check out this [guide](/platform-guide/alert-system/notification-system/alert-templates) to learn more about configuring alert templates.
  - Notification rules can now be deleted, even if the associated alert has been processed.  
  - Similarly, alert rules can now be deleted even if notification rules using these alert rules exist.  
  <Warning>Deleting an alert rule will also delete all the associated notification rules.</Warning>

## Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements
  - **Auto-Retry Mechanism**: Actions now automatically retry if auto-retry is enabled, even if the action times out.  
  - **Launch Shell Visibility Change**: The Launch Shell action has been removed from Actions List and Device Management but remains available in Historical Actions List.  
  - **UI Refinements in Alerts & DBC Parsers**: Hovering over the name now reveals both the ID and name, making the interface cleaner while still providing access to key details.
