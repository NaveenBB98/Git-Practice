## Device management design overhaul

We have made more space in the device management by organising the Metadata, Device shadow and recent Action details inside the collapsible Accordion.

## Advanced edit in dashboards

When you edit the dashboard you get an 'Advanced Edit' option at the bottom, on clicking it you get taken to editor page, where power users can directly edit the JSON body of the Dashboard
