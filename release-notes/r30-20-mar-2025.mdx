## Live Alerts dashboard

We have introduced an **Alerts Dashboard** section within the **Alerts** tab to provide real-time visibility into ongoing alerts. Users can:

  - Filter alert rules to view a specific set instead of all available rules.
  - Enable the **Group by Alert Groups** toggle to organize alerts by group.
  - Apply custom time ranges to focus on alerts within a specific period.
  - Benefit from continuous table refresh, ensuring updated alert data is always available.

This feature allows to monitor alerts directly without navigating into other dashboards.

## Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements
  - **Shareable Filtered Views via URL**: Applied filters in sections like Device Management are now included in the URL query parameters, making it easier to share a specific filtered view. 
  - **Real-Time Updates in Device Actions Table**: The Device List table for any action now auto-refreshes, allowing users to track action progress without manual intervention.
  - **Default Filter in Dashboards**: Dashboards now include ID/serial key filter options by default, ensuring users always have the option to filter devices, especially when creating a device dashboard.
