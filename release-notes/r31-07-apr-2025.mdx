We have introduced a Last Heartbeat filter in the Device Management section to enhance device monitoring. Users can:

  - Select predefined time intervals such as a few seconds, 5 minutes, or 1 hour.
  - Use the Custom option to enter a specific number and choose from time units like seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or years.
  - Combine this filter with existing metadata and device shadow filters for more precise device management.

This feature allows users to quickly filter active devices and perform operations such as triggering OTA updates and downloading metadata for the filtered devices.
## Panel search in Dashboards

Users can now search using a panel type (e.g., line chart), panel title, stream names used in the panel, or column names within the panel.
This feature enhances panel filtering within dashboards, making it especially useful for navigating dashboards with a large number of panels.
<Note> Ensure all changes are saved before applying a search. If modifications are made after applying the search filter, remove the filter first and then save the changes.</Note>

## Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements
  - **User Data in OTA Updates**: A user data field is now available when triggering an OTA update, allowing additional details, such as custom instructions, to be sent. These instructions can prompt the end user for confirmation before installation.
  - **Shareable Filtered Views**: Filters applied in the Alerts Dashboard are now reflected in the URL, allowing users to easily share specific filtered views.
  - **Null Filters for Metadata**: Added support for null and not null operators in metadata filters, enabling filtering based on missing or available metadata keys.
