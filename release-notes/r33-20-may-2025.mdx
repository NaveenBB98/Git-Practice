## Important Update

## Improved Filtering Experience in Device Management

**Multi-Value Metadata Filters**: You can now enter multiple values for metadata keys simultaneously, allowing for more refined device selection.

**Chained Filtering**: Combine multiple filters using parameters such as **Device ID**, **Metadata Keys**, **Device Shadow**, and **Last Heartbeat** to build complex queries with ease.

Filters have been moved into a clean, dropdown modal. This modal allows the following.
  - Add multiple filtering conditions.
  - Apply various operators and logic.
  - Reset filters with a single click.
  
<Note>When **Device Shadow** filters are active, automatic refresh is paused. Use the refresh icon to get the latest data.</Note>

These updates significantly improve usability and control, allowing for more dynamic and efficient device management.


## Enhanced Device Selection in Device Management

Users can now use **"Select All"** when device shadow filters are applied. The device list is frozen during selection to prevent changes from live data refreshes, making bulk actions like **OTA updates** more reliable.

For example, if you're planning to perform an OTA firmware update for all devices running a specific version, you can:

- Apply the device shadow filter based on the firmware version.  
- Use the **"Select All"** checkbox to select all filtered devices.  
- Trigger the **"Update Firmware"** action with confidence, knowing the targeted devices remain unchanged during selection.

## Layout Refinement for Cleaner Dashboard Experience

Weâ€™ve made subtle but impactful layout improvements to enhance clarity and usability across the dashboards:

Grouped the **Compare**, **Dashboard History**, and **Settings** options together and converted them into icons for a cleaner look.  
Moved the **filter** section to the left side to better align with natural scanning patterns.  
Relocated the **+ Panel** button below and redesigned it as a Call-to-Action (CTA) for better visibility and intuitive access. 

These layout changes aim to make navigation more seamless and actions easier to discoverâ€”without affecting existing functionality.


## Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements
  - **State update issue in Device Actions**: Resolved a bug where button states did not immediately reflect cancelling, retrying, or completing actions on devices
  - **Toggle selection persistence in Inventory**: Toggle selections in the Inventory view will now persist more reliably across interactions
  - **Dashboard options hidden for newly created dashboards**: To minimize visual clutter and improve user focus, dashboard options are now initially hidden for new dashboards.
