## DBC RBAC Enhancements

![](/assets/Create_Role.png)
Weâ€™ve introduced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the DBC Parsers section to provide granular permission management. Now, roles can be configured with fine-grained access including the ability to:

- View DBC Parsers
- Create, Edit, Start, Stop, Delete Parsers  
- Update Parsers  
- Download DBC Parsers

These permissions can be managed via the **Create/Edit Role** modal. Once assigned, users will only see and perform actions permitted by their role.  
Additionally, **DBC Parsers** has been moved from the **Settings** menu to the **Top Navigation Bar** for quicker access.

## Device IDs support in Alert Rules and Session Types

Weâ€™ve added the ability to target specific devices when configuring Alert Rules and Session types. 

Instead of applying rules across all devices, users can now associate rules with selected **Device IDs** only.

This improves how precisely users can define targeting conditions. Users can view associated devices via **tooltips** by hovering over the alert rule name or session type name.

## Filtering in Notification Rules

![](/assets/notification_channel_count.png)
Weâ€™ve added a **channel-based filter** to the Notification Rules page to streamline rule management.

- Easily filter notification rules by their associated channel.  
- A **count** is displayed next to each channel to provide a quick overview of rule distribution.

<Note>The count is displayed in **Users** section as well for Roles.</Note>
## Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements

- **Simplified Alert and Notification Rule Configuration**: Included alert rule type and channel selection directly in the Create/Edit Alert Rule and Notification Rule modals to eliminate the extra configuration step.

- **Alert Rule Count Per Group**: Displayed the alert rule count for each alert group in the Alert Rules section for better visibility and management. 

- **Session Type Visibility Based on Alerts Toggle**: Automatically hide the Session Types section when the Alerts & Notifications section is disabled to keep the interface clean and context-aware.
