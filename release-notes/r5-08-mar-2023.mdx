## **Data pipeline metrics**

We've added support to generate and collect important metrics in data pipeline. Metrics include:

- Metering data like:
  - Number of active connections   &#x20;
  - Amount of data received from devices    &#x20;
  - Amount of data received on subscription
- Alerting data to capture errors&#x20;

These metrics will be integrated with the UI and will be available for users soon.

## Bug fixes & Minor changes

- Change range in Line Chart only when the data has been fetched instead of before loading the complete data to avoid confusion
- Line Chart - Tooltip not completely visible when have to show many data points
- Fixed the loader not working properly when previous request was aborted in dashboard filters and time range change
- Bug fix in Welcome screen when new user was seeing blank screen
