### Incremental loading of panels when loading dashboards

The dashboard's panels will load progressively rather than attempting to load all panel data simultaneously. This approach enhances dependability and improves error management within the dashboard. If a particular panel encounters an issue, it will not hinder the entire dashboard's functionality. Instead, only the affected panel will be emphasised, with the option to refresh its data.

### Basic validations for data type in Panels

Added basic validation in panels based on the data type of columns, it will prevent basic errors in the panel data due to mismatch between data types

- If the String type column is selected in the panels, it will only show 'Min' and 'Max' Aggregates

### Showing action errors in device management

If any action has failed, you can see the status as well as the error message in Device Management directly
