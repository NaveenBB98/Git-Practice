### Actions V2

A new user interface has been released for viewing Action status, featuring improved visual representation and more detailed information. While the existing Action functionality will continue to operate as usual, it will gradually be phased out as the new UI adds additional capabilities and becomes more stable.

Check out documentation for more details: [Actions V2](<../Bytebeam docs/Actions.md>)&#x20;
